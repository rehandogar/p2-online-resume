# p2-online-resume

This is a dynamically created online resume project claiming the vary basics of single page applications like taking data from the model inserting it in template to create a view. This project is also using the google map APIs that iterate over the locations array to programmatically insert the markers on map. You can view my resume [here](https://rehanumar.github.io/p2-online-resume/index.html).

## How to run the application
- Download the repository as zip file in your computer or alternatively you can clone or fork it.
- Start the local server and then visit the `index.html` file in your browser.
